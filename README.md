## The big questions (Hints for the presentation)

These are a list of the biggest questions we are most likely to be asked during the presentation, these are some of the resources
to try and answer them (note to utkarsh 12 b), please write the below answers in your own words and add them to the power point.

* Why not just use the sites which are scraped from:
    1) Because ours is better, the sites in question often have large issues.(Basically add a little bit of slander about other sites which we are scraping from to make this project look better.)
        * toppr often doesn't load properly
        * brainly has paid restrictions
        * sarthaks has technical issues with their site.
        * mathway is for math questions only and it doesn't defrentiate between the the most 
        Commonly asked method of solving and the rest.

        * etc
    
    2) Because the explinations are better.
        * make a point of how we use ai technolegy to get a good and relevant summary of the pages scraped depending on the question asked.

* Why not just use google
    1) Because for every useful site you will find 10 which are not relevant, incorrect or otherwise not a good answer to the question given

    2) Because google simply provides the links and if the quesiton is of the obscure variety then it will take a long time to go through all the searches and get a result.

The Code is left public on purpose.
